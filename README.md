# C-Program-Sort

It took me four days to write the code.

This is a function similar to the qsort() function of c language. We can enter different types of arrays for sorting

advantageï¼š
1.Use structure and enumerator to encapsulate the parameters of Sort() function, The purpose of this is to quickly select and modify parameters.

2.You can choose not to change the original data, Only return one void* pointer array array, we can traversed it in order, it is the element after the order.
